Connect Four is a fun two-player connection game in which the players take turns dropping one colored disc red or yellow from the top into a seven-column, six-row vertically suspended grid. The pieces fall straight down, occupying the lowest available space within the column. The objective of the game is to be the first to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of four of one's own colored discs.

### This version perks

* Yellow disk always starts into the center column of the game board
* The columns to be played by both players are random(for now)
